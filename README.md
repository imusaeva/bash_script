This is a repository for my simple bash scripting learning with AkumoSolutions

What is in a bash script?

A bash script is a series of commands written in a file. These are read and executed by the bash program. The program executes line by line. For example, you can navigate to a certain path, create a folder and spawn a process inside it using the command line.

Bash scripts - are the next step in complexity. Most shells have their own scripting language with variables, control flow and its own syntax. What makes shell scripting different from other scripting programming language is that it is optimized for performing shell-related tasks. Thus, creating command pipelines, saving results into files, and reading from standard input are primitives in shell scripting, which makes it easier to use than general purpose scripting languages.

Here are some basic examples of bash_scripts , for_loop and while_loop scripts , API calls, if conditions , functions etc.
To be able to execute your bash cript , first we need to change the permission of the file with 
```
chmod +x name_of_the_file.sh
```
and then execute your script with 
```
./name_of_the_file.sh
```

Happy codding :)

# bash_script
This is a repository for my simple bash scripting learning

Bash script - Shell scripts are the next step in complexity. Most shells have their own scripting language with variables, control flow and its own syntax. What makes shell scripting different from other scripting programming language is that it is optimized for performing shell-related tasks. Thus, creating command pipelines, saving results into files, and reading from standard input are primitives in shell scripting, which makes it easier to use than general purpose scripting languages.


Here we used basic bash_scripts and also some for_loop and while_loop scripts , API calls and Python3 scripts
